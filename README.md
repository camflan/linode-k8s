## K8s on Linode
This is my attempt to build a production ready cluster on Linode using Terraform. I've seen several, bash-heavy, k8s-on-linode deployment projects, but they don't seem as readable or scalable as something such as Terraform/Ansible, so here's my attempt to learn Terraform and get k8s on Linode.  

If you have feedback or improvements, please contribute!
